This bowl brings together everything I crave on an OMAD day: heat, creaminess, texture, and depth. Kimchi adds funk and bite, the cream brings it all together, and the yolk? Pure luxury. Rinse and dry-fry those shirataki noodles well first — it makes all the difference.

**Note:** The noodles used here are a full pack (approx. 200g), making this a proper meal for one.

### Ingredients:

| Metric  | US     | Ingredient                                  |
|---------|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| 200 g   | 7 oz   | Shirataki noodles (1 full pack)             |
| 60 ml   | ¼ cup  | Heavy cream (or unsweetened almond cream)   |
| 30 g    | 1 oz   | Kimchi, chopped                             |
| 1       |        | Egg yolk (for topping)                      |
| 2       |        | Low-carb sausages, sliced                   |
| 30 g    | 1 oz   | Mushrooms, sliced                           |
| 1       |        | Spring onion, finely sliced                 |
| 1 tsp   | 5 ml   | Sesame seeds                                |
| 1 tsp   | 5 ml   | Homemade chili oil                          |
|         |        | Salt and pepper, to taste                   |

### Instructions:

1. Rinse shirataki noodles thoroughly and dry-fry in a hot pan until firm and lightly golden. Set aside.
2. In the same pan, sauté sliced mushrooms and sausage until browned.
3. Add chopped kimchi and cook for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.
4. Pour in the cream and let it simmer briefly. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Add the noodles and toss to coat evenly.
6. Plate in a wide bowl. Top with a raw egg yolk, sliced scallions, sesame seeds, and a drizzle of chili oil.

**Tip:** Add a dash of soy sauce, toban djan or a bit more gochugaru for extra umami and heat if needed.
